Data Preprocessing Practice

This repository contains hands-on practice notebooks focused on data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering techniques commonly used in real-world machine learning workflows.

Overview

The notebooks in this repository cover the following topics:

Handling missing values (mean, median, and advanced imputation techniques)

Removing duplicates and resolving inconsistent records

Outlier detection and treatment

Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)

Feature scaling (Standardization and Normalization)

Data type corrections and formatting

Text preprocessing fundamentals (where applicable)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to guide preprocessing decisions

Feature transformation and feature creation

Tools and Libraries Used

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualization)

PyTorch preprocessing utilities (where required)

Purpose

The objective of this repository is to develop a strong understanding of how raw data is transformed into model-ready datasets.

Rather than relying solely on automated pipelines, this work emphasizes:

Understanding why each preprocessing step is necessary

Identifying when to apply specific techniques

Analyzing how preprocessing decisions impact model performance

Repository Structure

Each notebook demonstrates preprocessing techniques applied to different datasets, with structured explanations and step-by-step implementation to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
